    "In UEDGE, a time-step of size bbb.dtreal is attempted at each evaluation of the function bbb.exmain(). If a solution is found for the set of equations being solved (see UEDGE documentation), the time-step is deemed a success, and all UEDGE variables are updated, as was discussed in Chapter 2. \n",

    "For finite time-steps, subsequent time-steps will keep evolving the solution owing to the $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t}$-term present in the equation. However, if the time-step is infinite, the simulation is at steady-state and subsequent evaluation will not evolve. This is typically the desired state of a UEDGE case, since the convergence of the simulation to within machine precision can be verified. \n",

    "\n",
    "When starting a new UEDGE simulation, it is recommended to start from a previously converged UEDGE simulation and make incremental changes. Thus, this tutorial will focus on how to incrementally modify cases, which is the preferred and recommended method.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Time-dependent solver<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"time-dependent-solver\"></a>\n",
    "The first way to reconverge a UEDGE case is the time-dependent solver, which is part of UEDGE. Here, the wrapped version of UETOOLS, Case.converge, will be the focus. After a change is made to the UEDGE setup (such as changing a boundary condition value), the time-dependent solver attempts to evolve the equations by small time-steps, which are progressively evolved to develop the solution until the solution is sufficiently close to its steady-state to accommodate $dt\\rightarrow\\infty$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Time-dependent runs are is the ideal solver when making discrete changes to the simulation (e.g. changing the grid, switching physics models), as it does not necessitate an intial steady-state solution. However, if changing a continuous parameter, it is advisable to change the paramaeter in small increments. This is recommmended to allow the closest minima, which the solver looks for, be the global minima of the residuals (e.g. the steady-state solution). If large changes are made to variables, the initial state may be sufficiently far away form the steady-state solution that the solver ends up into local minima, which are not the steady-state solution. This results in long computational times and, in some cases, causes the simulations to not achieve converge at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several parameters that can be used to control the time-dependent run, the most central of which are presented below:\n",
    "- dtreal: the initial time-step the runs tarts from\n",
    "- savefname: the name of intermediate save files writte (\\<savefname\\>\\_last\\_ii2.hdf5)\n",
    "- ii1_max: total number of outer iterations, determining the stopping point of unsuccessful simulations\\\n",

    "## Continuation solver<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"continuation-solver\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "In situations where a steady-state solution is available, and a change to continuous variables is desired, the continuation solver is a powerful alternative to the time-dependent solver. Contrary to the time-dependent solver, the continuation solver varies the desired variable value(s) from their initial steady-state values to the desired target values in a series of steady-state exmain-evaluations for small increments to the variable. This method means every evaluation produces a steady-state solution for a state that is slightly perturbed towards the desired final state. \n",
    "\n",
    "The continuation solver can be significantly more efficient than the time-dependent solver when modifying the UEDGE setup, but is unable to accommodate discrete changes (such as changing grid dimension, switching physics model), when the time-dependent solver must be used. In general, it is useful to employ both solvers in parallel and employ the most efficient one.\n",
    "\n",
    "One additional benefit of the continuation solver is that it produces a set of steady-state solutions between the initial and final states, creating a parameter scan over one or several variables. The continuation solver design also allows it to \"creep up to\" numerically challenging regions of parameter-space, where it will employ the time-dependent solver to bridge any bands in parameter-space where no solution exists. The incremental increase for the variable value(s) is being dynamically varied based on the algorithm success, striving to take as large as possible steps in parameter space while remaining at steady-state. In case an initial step cannot be taken, try increasing the initial resolution (e.g. steps required to achieve the target) by increasing the kwarg initres, or by reducing the target value(s).\n",

Alternatively, the variable bbb.GridFileName can be made to point to the new grid. It is strongly recommended to maintain the same number of polodal cells in the inner leg, core region, and outer leg, as well as the radial cells in the private-flux/core region and the main SOL. Changing these variables may result in sufficient deviations from the steady state that the solvers are unable to find a steady-state soution.
