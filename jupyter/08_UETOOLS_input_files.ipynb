    "\n",
    "UETOOLS provides functionality for defining YAML input files. This chapter will focus on the UEDGE-specific setup of YAL input files, and will not discuss the YAML syntax except where it is pertinent to the setup file. There is an abundancy of free YAML tutorials available, such as [this one](https://www.educative.io/blog/yaml-tutorial). UETOOLS uses the \"pyaml\" package to read the the YAML input files, and applies an internal parses to the loaded data.\n",

Thus, diff_file is commonly not defined in the input deck, meaning UETOOLS restores the diffusivities from the save-file. Any modifications made interactively to the UEDGE case in an active UEDGE session will be tracked by the UETOOLS save file. \n",
    "\n",
    "In situations where one needs to change the diffusivities of a UEDGE simulation to match that of another UEDGE simulation converged using UETOOLS, the functions Case.radialdiff and Case.userdiff can be used to restore the radial and 2D diffusivities from another UETOOLS save file (or any compatible HDF5 file). This will automatically set the necessary diffusivity profiles.\n",
    "\n",
    "To only change a subset of the diffusivity profiles, the function Case.hdf5search (see Chapter 9) can be utilized to change the infividual diffusivity coefficients, e.g.:\n",
    "\n",
    "    bbb.dif_use = c.hdf5search(<filename>, \"dif_use\")\n",
    "    \n",
    "**NOTE:** the case the diffusivity profiles are imported from must have the same dimension arrays as the case they are imported to (e.g. nx, ny, and nisp). There are no checks on the cell distribution (e.g. ixpt1, ixpt2, iysptrx) or cell distribution between cases and are the responsibility of the user. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Writing a dedicated diffusivity file<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"dedicated-file\"></a>\n",
    "Any external script that produces a compatible diffusivity HDF5 file may be used to produce such a file, which can then be read using diff_file. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** the diffusivities read from the external file are re-written to any UETOOLS save-files, meaning there is no need to use an external file after using UETOOLS to write a save file.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Calling an external script <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"external-script\"></a>\n",
    "The \"commands\" input deck (see below) can be used to call external scripts or functions, which modify the diffusivity coefficients in UEDGE. Since any lines in the \"command\" input-deck are performed after all other inputs are read and executed, any such scripts/modifications will overwrite the diffusivities read from diff_file etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** any changes made to the diffusivities in external scripts called from the \"command\" input-deck are written to the UETOOLS save-file. Thus, the external script only needs to be called when making the intiial changes, after which the input file can be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The \"commands\" input deck<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"commands-deck\"></a>\n",
    "The special input deck \"commands\" can be used in situations when it is necessary to make Python calls as part of the input file, such as when UEDGE is used to pupulate arrays that later are modified. One such example is when setting localized pumping surfaces using the switch albedo_by_use:\n",
    "\n",
    "    commands:\n",
    "        - self.populate()\n",
    "        - bbb.albedo_by_user = 1\n",
    "        - bbb.albrb[24:30] = 0.9\n",
    "        \n",
    "                \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"commands\" input-deck consists of a list of pure-Python commands, treated as strings, which are read and executed line-by line. In the above example, Case.populate is called to populate the UEDGE arrays used for recycling, such as albrb and alblb. **Note:** Because the lines in \"commands\" are parsed internally by the Case object, any calls to methods belonging to Case must be called using self.function rather than by Case.function. The second line tells UEDGE to use the albrb and alblb arrays defining the radial albedo profiles along the right and left boundaries, respectively, as-is rather than populating them based using albedorb and albedolb. Finally, the third line modifies the previously populated arrays to define a pumping surface over a subset of the target cells. \n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** The \"commands\" input deck can, in principle, be used to evaluate confditionals or create loops, but the syntax becomes complicated since each line is executed as a command. That means, each line must contain a full, valid python command, so conditionals or loops must be defined completely on a single line:\n",
    "\n",
    "**VALID**\n",
    "\n",
    "    commands:\n",
    "        - \"for i in range(10):\\n    print(i)\"\n",
    "**INVALID**\n",
    "\n",
    "    commands:\n",
    "        - for i in range(10):\\n    print(i)\n",
    "**INVALID**\n",
    "        \n",
    "    commands:\n",
    "        - \"for i in range(10):\"\n",
    "        - \"    print(i)\"\n",
    "Thus, it is recommanded to utilize external scripts for executing any complex commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "In file script.py:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def print_series(N)\n",
    "        for i in range(N):\n",
    "            print(i)\n",
    "\n",
    "In input file:\n",
    "\n",
    "    commands:\n",
    "        - from script import print_series\n",
    "        - print_series(10)\n",
    "        \n",
    "### Commands and saves<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"commands-saves\"></a>\n",
    "Any commands defined in the input file are stored to to the save-file after execution:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    <HDF5 file \"save.hdf5\" (mode r)>\n",
    "    └── setup\n",
    "        └── commands\n",
    "        \n",
    "When restoring a UEDGE case from a save file using UETOOLS (see Chapter 4), the commands are not executed because the paths to external scripts may be broken, etc. Instead, when restoring a Case from a save file using UETOOLS, the commands are ignored and UETOOLS restores the automatically detected changes, as explained in Chapter 4. Thus, UETOOLS save files should work as self-contained UEDGE cases regardless of the changes done in the \"commands\" input-deck, since any changes affecting the setup is detected and carried along with the case in the save-file.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Rate files<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"rate-files\"></a>\n",
    "The reaction rates used in UEDGE are defined in separate external files. All of these files are not publicly avialable and, thus, cannot be distributed with UEDGE. Therefore, the files used, and location of the files, will be different for the individual users. This section will shortly outline how to define the paths to the different rate files, and what the precedence is between the different methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "UEDGE looks for the hydrogen and impurity rate files in the locations specified by aphdir and apidir, respectively. The UEDGE default is the current work directory. The paths may be defined in a .uedgerc.py file (see UEDGE documentation). If the aphdir and apidir are defined in .uedgerc.py they will be used unless they are defined in the input file, as this definition takes precedence. \n",
    "\n",
    "UETOOLS also offers two options for setting the rate paths. The rate paths can be set in the UETOOLS rc file .uetoolsrc in the user's home directory. This file can be created manually or by calling Case.configcase (see Chapter 1). If .uetoolsrc (which is a single-depth YAML file) contains definitions for aphdir apidir, these definitions will take precedence over the paths defined in .uedgerc.py or in any UETOOLS YAML input file. \n",
    "\n",
    "Just like the special variables discussed above, aphdir and apidir can be set upon creation of a Case object by supplying the kwargs aphdir and apidir. Any rate paths defined when creating an object will take precedence over those defined in .uetoolsrc.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, any external input files will take precedence over all of the above, as re-defining the variables directly in UEDGE memory bypasses UETOOLS completely. The same holds for definitions of aphdir/apidir in the \"commands\" input deck.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. External scripts (including calls in the \"commands\" input deck)\n",
    "2. Kwargs supplied when create the Case object\n",
    "3. .uetoolsrc\n",

The primary concern is the Python commands in the \"commands\" input deck and the automatically detected changes in the input file. \n",

    "Case.write_yaml does not write the vairables with automatically detected changes to the input files because, as discussed in Chapter 4, UETOOLS detects changes to a number of 2D arrays that can be used as inputs for certain UEDGE setups. Thus, writing all of these variables to an input file would make the file unreadable. Instead, Case.write_yaml reverts to using the Python commands defined in the original input file's \"commands\" deck. Any changes made to variables that are not listed in the general input decks in the original input file after loading the case from the input file will be lost. Furthermore, any commands calling local scripts may now have broken paths, if the UETOOLS save is no longer in the same location."
